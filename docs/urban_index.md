This recreates the Urban Institute's [Emergency Rental Assistance Priority Index](https://www.urban.org/features/where-prioritize-emergency-rental-assistance-keep-renters-their-homes) for Louisville. The original index compares Louisville to the rest of Kentucky. At Greater Louisville Project, we think the more appropriate comparison is to our other peer cities. While the maps below show Louisville, the index values are based on a comparison to all census tracts in the core counties of our peer cities.

Greater Louisville Project has also aggregated the data up to the metro council district level. That data is available in both maps and tables.

In addition to the indexes, the indicators that make up the indexes are also mapped below. Navigation is based on tabs, so clicking on the small blue titles brings up the map related to each title.

## Methods and Definitions

To produce an index with multiple indicators on different scales we used z-scores, which are a measure of how far away from average an observation is. For example, if looking at unemployment, we start with the unemployment rate in all tracts and the score for an individual tract is the number of standard deviations it is away from the average tract.

Data is from the Urban Institute's [Emergency Rental Assistance Priority Index](https://www.urban.org/features/where-prioritize-emergency-rental-assistance-keep-renters-their-homes) and in most cases is tract level census data from 2018. The low income jobs lost to Covid is an [Urban Institute constructed indicator](https://www.urban.org/features/where-low-income-jobs-are-being-lost-covid-19). Complete details on the indicators can be found in the [technical appendix](https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/2020/08/24/where_to_prioritize_emergency_rental_assistance_to_keep_renters_in_their_homes_technical_appendix.pdf), but they are summarized here for convenience.

### Housing Instability Index

-   Poverty: Under the poverty line in the last 12 months
-   Percent Renting: The percent of households in the area who rent
-   Cost Burdened: Households making less than 35,000 and paying more than 50% of their income in rent
-   Overcrowding: Households renting and with more than 1.5 people per room.
-   Unemployed: In the labor force but not currently employed.

### Covid Index

-   Health Insurance: Based on the noninstitutionalized population ages 19-64.
-   Low Income Job Loss from Covid: Estimated jobs lost to Covid based on previous [Urban Institute Study](https://www.urban.org/features/where-low-income-jobs-are-being-lost-covid-19)

### Equity Index

-   Percent Persons of Color: Percent of people in the area who identify as persons of color
-   Extremely Low Income: Renter occupied household making less than 30 percent of area median income
-   Public Assistance: Percent receiving some form of public assistance like SNAP or TANF
-   Foreign Born: Percent born outside the U.S.

## Home Mortgages

### Mortgages by geography

In 2019, about 3.8 mortgages were issued per 100 residents; however, the availability of mortgages varies greatly across the city. Two census tracts saw 0 mortgages issued in 2019, and most of West Louisville saw fewer than 1 mortgage issued per 100 residents. Meanwhile, many areas experienced a much larger availability of mortgages, especially where there is new construction around the edges of the county.

### Mortgages by race

We can also examine mortgage data by race. Black residents in Louisville received fewer than half the number of mortgages per person that White residents did in 2019.


```r

```

### Mortgage Dollars by race

The racial disparity is mortgages is even larger when you incorporate the dollar amount of mortgages issues. In 2019, white residents received \$2.60 in mortgages for every \$1 that Black residents received after adjusting for population size.


```r
plt_by(mortgage_county, Race, loan_amount_pp, "Mortgage Lending by race", y_axis = "Dollars per 100 People", y_min = 0,
       units = "Dollars")
```

<img src="urban_index_files/figure-html/mortgage_dollars_race-1.png" width="672" />

### Denial Rates by Race

Black residents are denied mortgages at a rate roughly twice that of white residents. The mortgage denial rate for Black residents has decreased from a high of 29% in 2008 to a low of 14% in 2019. However, it has not shown signs of decreasing in recent years, and Black residents are more likely to be impacted by the economic impacts of COVID-19, worsening the disparity in 2020 and beyond.


```r
plt_by(mortgage_county, Race, denial, "Mortgage Denial by race", y_axis = "Denial Rate", y_min = 0, units= "Percent")
```

<img src="urban_index_files/figure-html/mortgage_denial_race-1.png" width="672" />

### Denial Rates by Geography

A major factor in mortgage availability is denial rates. While some areas of town saw few to no mortgage denials, people in many parts of West Louisville experienced denial rates of 30 to 40%.


```r
make_map(denial, title = "Mortgage Denial Rate in 2019", 
         legend = "Percent", 
         caption = "Denial rate")
```

<img src="urban_index_files/figure-html/mortgage_denial-1.png" width="672" />

### Interest Rates by geography

For the mortgages that were issued, interest rates varied from around 3.5% to around 5%. While the average interest rate was around 4% for the much of East Louisville, average interest rates in West Louisville were closer to 5%. A 30-year mortgage with an interest rate of 5% requires monthly payments that are 13% higher than a mortgage with an interest rate of 4%.


```r
make_map(rate, title = "Mortgage Interest Rate in 2019", 
         legend = "Percent", 
         caption = "Interest rate")
```

<img src="urban_index_files/figure-html/mortgage_interest-1.png" width="672" />

## Housing Price Changes

As Louisville grows, increasing home prices reflect changes in inflation and increasing demand for homes. Long-term growth in home prices helps homeowners build equity and wealth. Short-term appreciation can be a boon to homeowners with the finances to stay in their home, though it also causes many homeowners and renters to be dislocated from their neighborhood.

### Long-term appreciation

This map shows the change in existing home prices across zip codes since 2000, controlling for new construction. Since 2000, existing homes in Louisville have increased in value by an average of 57% (an average of about 2.4% per year). However, not every area of the city has benefited equally from this growth. Home prices in zip code 40204, which contains the Upper Highlands and Germantown, have more than doubled since 2000. While many zip codes close to downtown also saw high growth, many parts of West Louisville saw slow growth, and homes in 40212 lost value.

### Short-term appreciation

Looking at the growth since 2015 highlights zip codes where changes in home prices have been very acute. The average home in Louisville increased in value by 21% between 2015 and 2019. The vast majority of zip codes saw total growth of 10% - 30%, while changes in home prices for zip codes in West Louisville range from a decrease of 30% in 40212 to an increase of 40% in 40203. The rapid price increase in 40203, which contains parts of Russell and Old Louisville, threaten to displace many residents. In 40203, home prices across Louisville increased by an average of 8.8% per year.

ggplot(map_zip) +

```

## Housing Availability

Housing must be both affordable and available for families to have housing that meets their needs. Based on framework from the Housing Needs Assessment, we compare households' incomes to the price of housing available to them.

We use the Area Median Income (AMI) to group households and housing units. In 2019, the AMI for Louisville was \$76,400 for a family of four. (The AMI adjusts for household size.) We also use AMI to group homes and apartments by determining whether the housing would be affordable to households in that income group. Housing is affordable is a household spends less than 30% of their income on housing costs. For a fuller explanation of AMI, see the next section.

We find that households making less than 30% of AMI do not have enough housing units available to them. While 39,000 households have incomes below 30% of AMI, there are only enough affordable and available units for about half of them of them.

This creates an affordability gap for households making between 30% and 50% of AMI. While there are actually more housing units than households at this income level, many of them are occupied by households with lower incomes, making them unavailable. The same problem exists for households in the 80% AMI income group.

At higher income levels, we find that households generally have access to affordable housing.

Creating housing opportunities for households below 30% of AMI would help ease the housing gap not only for them, but for households in higher income groups as well.

The table below shows the cutoffs for family income, monthly rent, and home purchase prices for each AMI group.

We group residents by percentages of the Area Median Income (AMI) as determined by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. In 2019, the AMI for a four-person household in Louisville was \$76,300. Median income means 50% of four-person families earned less than the AMI, and 50% earned more. The AMI is adjusted down for smaller households and up for larger households. For example, the AMI for a person living alone is \$54,000, and the AMI for a six-person household is \$89,000.

Households in the 30% AMI income group have income less than or equal to the Federal Poverty Level (about 30% of \$76,300). Households in the 50% AMI group have income between the Federal Poverty Level and 50% of the AMI. Households in the 80% AMI income group have income between 50% of the AMI and 80% of the AMI, and so on for higher AMI levels.

We group homes and apartments by AMI by determining the minimum income needed for a household to live there affordably (without spending more than 30% of their income on housing costs). We adjust housing costs by bedroom size to align with how the AMI for households is adjusted by household size.

We determine the AMI group of apartments using monthly rent and utilities. We determine the AMI group of homes based on the value of the home in order to measure the affordability of homeownership for new buyers, rather than cost-burden for existing homeowners. Based on the conversion used in the Housing Needs Assessment, we calculate that the annual cost of homeownership is about 1/13th of the home's value.

More details on the methodology can be found in the Housing Needs Assessment and the Housing Needs Assessment Methodology:
