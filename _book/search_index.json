As the COVID-19 pandemic further revealed the deadly racial disparities here in Louisville, and across the nation, a group of local Black activists, leaders, and advocates began holding weekly meetings. The goal was to keep our community alive. Once again, it was proven that existing systems were not designed to help us. During this already trying time, our community was hit with the murder of Breonna Taylor. Centuries of pain and frustration spilled into the streets. As society began discussing a return to normalcy, we knew that normal would continue to kill us. This document is not going to solve every problem facing Louisville. However, it is a road map for future opportunities. We chose projects and initiatives that would allow us to prove to funders and policy makers that we can take care of ourselves. In fact, we have been caring for ourselves for centuries. We have just always lacked money and power. Fortunately, we were able to secure funding to get started. We will collect and analyze data to evaluate the funded programs. For centuries, data has been collected and analyzed about us. This initiative will highlight the data that our community has already been collecting, while we also expand beyond traditional measures of success to provide a more accurate picture of our community and how we define it success. This data will help us challenge existing racist narratives by asking questions others have not asked us about, and connections between data points that were never made. The data will help us tell our story. We will track successes and failures as we dismantle oppressive systems and create new systems that are safe for our community. In response to the A Path Forward document, GLP took the courageous step to align with this initiative, even moving beyond the original intent of GLP. We took a step to do the right thing. In that light, we produced 4 reports, on the topics of the digital divide, housing, early childhood education, and Black wealth. Along with each report, we held community conversations, where neighbors within the Black community could speak for themselves. The feedback from these conversations has been positive and we have seen ripples within the community to keep these conversations going. As we recognized the one-year anniversary of the release of the A Path Forward document, we here at GLP realize that the work is not over. However we are willing to be an accomplice on the side of justice. We hope that you look at this data and see, and even feel, the sense of urgency in addressing these issues. We hope that you are moved to catalyze civic change within your own sphere of influence and by using your own skills, talents, and resources. We hope you will support us. Monica E.
